      Transparency matters. Here's everything you need to know about how affiliate links work on BioVault Health.
    </p>

    <section class="mb-5">
      <h2>Affiliate Relationships</h2>
      <p>
        Some of the links on this website are affiliate links, which means that if you click on one of them and make a purchase, we may earn a small commission—at no additional cost to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        These commissions help us keep BioVault Health running and allow us to continue producing high-quality, helpful wellness content.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-5">
      <h2>Why We Use Affiliate Links</h2>
      <p>
        We only promote products we believe in. Each supplement we recommend has been carefully vetted for quality, transparency, and alignment with our health values.
      </p>
      <p>
        We never accept money for positive reviews or biased promotion. Our opinions are our own, and we aim to provide honest, science-backed guidance first and foremost.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-5">
      <h2>Does This Affect You?</h2>
      <p>
        No. If you decide to purchase a product through an affiliate link, the price remains the same for you. In some cases, you may even receive a discount or bonus content exclusive to BioVault Health readers.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Your Trust Comes First</h2>
      <p>
        We value the trust you place in us. That’s why we’re upfront about how we earn revenue through affiliate partnerships. If you have any questions, feel free to  contact us at <a href="mailto:info@biovaulthealth.com">info@biovaulthealth.com</a>.
